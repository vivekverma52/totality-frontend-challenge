# rental-property

React is the foundation of my rental-property website, enabling the creation 
of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It helps manage various parts of 
the website, such as booking forms, room details, and user dashboards. I 
use React components to structure the homepage, room listings, and 
booking confirmation pages. React hooks like useState manage dynamic 
data, such as selected dates and room types, while useContext shares 
user information across different pages.
react provides accessible UI components without predefined styles, 
allowing me to customize them according to my websiteâ€™s design. On my 
site, I use these components for dropdown menus, modals (like house 
booking confirmations), and mobile navigation, styling them with Tailwind 
CSS to align with my brand.
Autoprefixer helps make sure that the styles on my hotel booking website 
work smoothly across different browsers. I use PostCSS along with 
Autoprefixer to streamline the styling process, making my CSS clean and 
maintainable.
React Router DOM manages navigation and routing within my app, enabling 
smooth transitions between pages without reloading the entire site. I use 
the Link component to navigate between different sections, such as from 
the homepage to room listings or booking confirmation pages.
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to quickly and 
efficiently create custom designs. It provides a set of predefined classes 
that I use to build responsive and visually appealing layouts for my hotel 
booking website.
useState is used to add state to functional components, managing 
dynamic data like selected booking dates or room types. useContext 
allows me to access context values across components without prop 
drilling, such as user authentication status or theme settings. 
createContext sets up contexts for shared data, like booking information, 
accessible by any component.
Link from React Router DOM facilitates client-side navigation, making it 
easy to move between pages without full page reloads. Icons from React 
Icons, such as RiMapPinLine, RiArrowDownLine, and RiArrowUpLine, 
enhance the user interface by visually representing features like location 
markers and dropdown menus. 
Here I have added the functionalities like filter, add to cart,Proceed to Payment.
It is fully responsive website. Here I have created the static data for database.
